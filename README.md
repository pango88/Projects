# Phonebook fullstack application
## Node, MongoDb, Express, React
### mongoose, eslint

This project renders the project via the backend, i still need to learn abit more about different hosting ways such as server side etc. But anyways commands are in package.json files...

The project is basically a phonebook, where you can add people and their numbers, sort by names, and ofc save the people to a database.
