# Some of the projects i've done so far!
## Node, MongoDb, Express, React, Graphql, Testing (Cypress, Jest), Typescript, Redux, Eslint, Mongoose...
### To name a few of the technologies i've used.

Most of the projects are sorted up in different branches and some branches contain multiple projects besides those explicitly named "fullstack" which only caints the back and front-end of a certain project. The repo is abit messy and i was debating on how to set it up but since this is mostly (if not only) for myself i figured it doesn't matter too much aslong as i feel like i can find the projects and use this repo. >_<
