// Might be an issue with the code and the togglable component, hence the test may need to be changed to fit my current code or i will have to rework the Blog components code and implement state and if/else statements probably. This issue only applies to assignment 5.13 and 5.14 specifically how the tests are supposed to work.

// As of right now what im aware of is that when you are in the browser the toggling works fine and doesnt show up by default, however in testmode it does, and it probably has to do with the fact that it anyways passes in the props even if its not "supposed" to be visible

// renders everything but not really 5.13. It also renders likes and url, even though the application doesnt
/*test('Bloglist renders blog correctly', () => {
  dispatch(createBlog(testBlog));
  const component = render(<BlogList />);
  component.debug();

  expect(component.container).toHaveTextContent('this is a test');
}); */

//5.14 url, number of likes show up test when button clicked. It does work but since 5.13 "doesnt rly work" and everything is shown by default on the test this one is abit iffy too. However i feel like there is no need to continue with this and that i can move on...
test('Url and likes are shown when view button is clicked', () => {
  const component = render(<BlogView blog={testBlog} />);
  /*const button = component.getByText('view');
  fireEvent.click(button); */

  expect(component.container).toHaveTextContent('hidden.com');
  expect(component.container).toHaveTextContent('likes: 0');
});

//5.15 like button clicked twice, event handler called twice
test('if like button is clicked twice the eventhandler is called twice', () => {
  const addLike = jest.fn();
  const component = render(<Blog blog={blog} addLike={addLike} />);

  const button = component.container.querySelector('.likeBtn');
  // Since im only calling this twice i just repeat it, since implementing a loop doesnt "really" clean anything up and most likely just slows the program down a tiny tiny bit
  fireEvent.click(button);
  fireEvent.click(button);

  expect(addLike.mock.calls).toHaveLength(2);
