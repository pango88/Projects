* generate a random id
* dispatch SET_NOTIFICATION with your notification and that random id
* after a timeout, dispatch HIDE_NOTIFICATION with the same random id

in the reducer
* on SET_NOTIFICATION, set a "current_notification_id" in the store
* on HIDE_NOTIFICATION only actually hide the notification if the dispatched id is the same as the current_notification_id

That way you won't mess around with cancelling timeouts - obsolete HIDE_NOTIFICATION actions just won't do anything.
